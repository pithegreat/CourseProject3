The different variables in this dataset describe measurements taken with an accelerometer and a gyroscope on a Samsung phone while a subject does an activity (walking, laying, etc.).  The variables that were taken from the orginial dataset represent the mean of standard devaiation values of any movements sensed by the phone.  Some of these variables include "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" which calculates the mean of body acceleration moving at the horizontal direction.  "Acc" means the acceleration sensed from an accelerometer while "gyro" means measurements from a gyroscope.  The difference between the variables with a prefix of "t" and a prefix of "f" is that the time is over time while the "f" had Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied to it producing it.
